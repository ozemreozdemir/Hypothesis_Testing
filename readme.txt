Hypothesis Testing
============================
Write a production level R-script that tests if 1) all states in 2011 Farm Subsidy data are equally represented and 2) all states in 2011 Farm Subsidy data are represented by farms/state equally.
Data is located on: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=newsroom&subject=landing&topic=foi-er-fri-pfi (Links to an external site.)
Need the 2011 Farm Payment File and the State and County Code List.  File names should be something like 'CAS.WDC11019.PMT11.FINAL.DT11186.TXT' and 'foia_state_county_codes-1.csv'
